        <p>Except I don't know why I am writing this. Perhaps I should apologise, perhaps I should say thank you or perhaps I should not say anything at all, but the last option is the hardest of all.</p>
        <p>I used to joke that many of my behavioural traits were because of you (made by you?). And the truth is there is some, if not a lot of truth in that. Somehow and being honest, I don't understand how this happened but you influenced who I was and who I am. Maybe we were similar to begin with but I still feel that you changed how I think and act.</p>
        <p>Obviously it was not all good influence, perhaps most of it was not and that's not surprising as ultimately it was you influencing. Regardless, most of it allowed me to improve me. (And I am not saying that because I am linguistically required to end the thought on a high but because I actually mean it)</p>
        <p>(The following refers to two and a half years or however long ago this was.)</p>
        <p>Now I did not realise this at the time and perhaps you might not have either but you helped me. You taught me to care for myself by caring and you taught me to love myself by loving (regardless of whether you actually did). And all of this was done when you were struggling more. Which leaves within me a feeling of guilt, especially with the fact I could never repay that which I had been given. In reality, instead of returning the favour, I hurt you.</p>
        <p>(The following refers to almost a year ago)</p>
        <p>I was scared. I enjoyed your company a lot. I don't know what it is about the way you articulate and construct your words or how you think that's just so fun. Genuinely, I don't understand how or where this creativity comes from. And I was scared to lose it. I was happy with how things were and I was afraid that any change would change things. Alas, I failed to realise that from some points, the road only goes forward or downwards, not backwards. Perhaps, it could be said I wanted a chase after the finish line but such a chase is and always will be useless as it lacks a purpose (a parable from my philosophical side which may very well not make much sense).</p>
        <p>I am sorry. I may have been confusing but I wanted to 'make things the way they used to be' without realising that, just like Dr. Driving, the road backwards is blockaded.</p>
        <p>I am not trying to deny that I liked you as more than just a friend. Perhaps, I was foolish enough to want forever. Maybe I thought there'd be a better time, maybe I thought haste might end the chances of forever, maybe I was dumb.</p>
        <p>Being young is weird honestly, and although I don’t agree with the actions of my past self, although I might not still be my past self, I feel that owning up to the actions of my past self is still my responsibility.</p>
        <p>With everything said, well everything that I remember; there is probably a lot that I’d wish I’d said that I’ll realise later. You might have been the most fun person to talk to that I’ve ever known and I miss that.</p>
        <p>Anyways, Happy Birthday, I hope you have a great day (and year). Also being 16 doesn’t feel much different from not being 16.</p>
